### About Me. 
I am now a senior student in UC Davis. I major in both Applied Statistics and Economics. I am now focusing on learning basic methods for data science and data visualization as well as stastical programming. Although I am new to this field, I have grown strong interests already!

### My Projects
1.
By the end of Winter Quarter, 2017, I had my first collaberate data science project (with Zhihan Zhu)! 
The project is about the trending words in the last week of Feburary 2017. Our motivation is to see what are some popular words that have been covered the most during that time period. A more detailed explannation can be found in our [project report](https://github.com/zyrr95/Final-Project-Sta-141B/blob/master/Project-Draft1.ipynb).
